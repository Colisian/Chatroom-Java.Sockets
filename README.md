## Chatroom Application

This is a chatroom application that I created to practice Java programming and Version Control practices.

Will mostly use this program as practice with Git commands and pushing commits and branches to GitHub from my local machine. 

Eventually would like to integate this with a GUI as I develop futher with Front-End practices with Java.
